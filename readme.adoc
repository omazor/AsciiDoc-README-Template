== About the Project
This repository provides a good foundation for establishing a README, written in AsciiDoc markup.  Documents written in AsciiDoc markup can be easily converted to HTML5, PDF, EPUB, and other formats.  Its syntax is similar to markdown, and includes extensive features and flexibility which make it suitable for writing high quality documentation.

AsciiDoc is simply plain-text.  You can author documents in your favorite text editor of choice, such as https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code] with a proper https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode[extension], or any derivative of https://github.com/qvacua/vimr[VIM].  If you're just getting started with AsciiDoc, you may want to try https://asciidocfx.com/[AsciidocFX], until the markup syntax becomes second nature to you.

[NOTE]
This README template does not include dependencies on features, such as Shields.io, which require the repository to be a public repository.


=== Built With
//This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] - a _fast_ text processor and publishing toolchain for converting AsciiDoc content to other formats.
* https://asciidocfx.com/[AsciidocFX] - a book / document editor to build PDF, Epub, Mobi and HTML books, documents, and slides.


== Getting Started
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.


=== Prerequisites
Select the prequisites procedure which aligns with your operating system of choice.

==== Installing _Git_ on _Linux_
Determine on *which _Linux_ distribution* your system is  ased on.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions[List of Linux distributions -- Wikipedia] -- for a list. *Most _Linux_ systems -- including _Ubuntu_ -- are _Debian_-based.*

===== _Debian_-based linux systems
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal[*Open a terminal window*]. *Copy & paste the following* into the terminal window and *hit* `Return`. You may be prompted to enter your password.

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install git
----

*You can use _Git_ now.*

====== _Red Hat_-based linux systems
*Open a terminal. Copy & paste the following* into the terminal window and *hit* `Return`. You may be prompted to enter your password.

[source,bash]
----
sudo yum upgrade
sudo yum install git
----

*You can use _Git_ now.*

==== Installing _Git_ on _macOS_
https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/2.11/mac/11.0[Open a terminal window].

===== Step 1 -- Install http://brew.sh/[_Homebrew_]
[NOTE]
_Homebrew_ [...] simplifies the installation of software on the macOS operating system.

*Copy & paste the following* into the terminal window and *hit* `Return`.

[source,bash]
----
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
----

You will be offered to install the _Command Line Developer Tools_ from _Apple_. *Confirm by clicking _Install_*. After the installation finished, continue installing _Homebrew_ by *hitting* `Return` again.

===== Step 2 -- Install _Git_
*Copy & paste the following* into the terminal window and *hit* `Return`.

[source,bash]
----
brew install git
----

[NOTE]
If you prefer the version of git included with Apple's Command Line Tools for Xcode, you can choose to skip installing git using _Homebrew_.

*You can use _Git_ now.*

==== Installing _Git_ on _Windows_
https://adamtheautomator.com/how-to-run-powershell-as-administrator/[Open PowerShell as Administrator].

===== Step 1 -- Install https://chocolatey.org/[_Chocolatey_]
[NOTE]
_Chocolatey_ is a software management for Windows. It brings the concepts of true package management to allow you to version things, manage dependencies and installation order, better inventory management, and other features.

*Copy & paste the following* into the _PowerShell_ window and *hit* `Return`.

[source,powershell]
----
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
----

Wait a few seconds for the command to complete. If you don't see any errors, you are ready to use Chocolatey.

===== Step 2 -- Install _Git_
*Copy & paste the following* into the _PowerShell_ window and *hit* `Return`.

[source,powershell]
----
choco install -y git
----

*You can now use _Git_ via launching the _Git BASH_ terminal for _Windows_.*


=== Installation
This repository is published as a template repository, hosted on GitHub. The branches within this repository include a _boilerplate_ README, as well as a _placeholder_ README, for your convenience.  To ensure you repository includes these convenience branches, you'll need create your repository from within the GitHub website.
[TIP]
While it is possible to create a repository from a template using the GitHub CLI, it currently does not support including all branches.  For more information, see `gh repo create` in the https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_create[GitHub CLI documentation].

== Usage
Once a new repository is created from this template, the boilerplate readme is displayed on the `main` branch.  This repository also includes the following two branches for convenience.

* *docs/readme-boilerplate*
** This branch includes an example of what a typical readme might look like.
** This has already been merged into `main`, and is what you're reading now.
** You'll likely want to create a branch from this so you can author your own custom readme.
* *docs/readme-placeholder*
** This branch includes an example of what a placeholder readme might look like.
** A placeholder readme is usually displayed until the actual readme is ready to be published.
** The use of a placeholder readme is a good practice to provide visitors to your repsository with a hint of what's to come.

=== Placeholder Readme
. Launch your terminal.
. Change the current working directory to the location where you already cloned the repository.
. *Copy & paste the following* into the terminal window and *hit* `Return`.
+
[source,bash]
----
git checkout docs/readme-placeholder
git checkout main
git rm readme.adoc
git clean -f .
git commit -m 'DOCS(readme):  purge boilerplate'
git merge docs/readme-placeholder -m 'DOCS(readme):  stage placeholder' --allow-unrelated-histories
----
. You can now edit the `readme.adoc` file to serve as a placeholder until the actual readme is ready to be published.

[TIP]
The example listed above is only a starting point for customizing the readme. Take a close look at the lines within to ensure you replace all the placeholder values. For example, don't forget to modify the HTML code near the top of the readme which is used when displaying on GitHub.
. Once your edits are complete, commit your changes and push to remote.
+
[source,bash]
----
git add .
git commit -m 'DOCS(readme):  set placeholder'
git push

=== Boilerplate Readme
. Launch your terminal.
. Change the current working directory to the location where you already cloned the repository.
. *Copy & paste the following* into the terminal window and *hit* `Return`.
+
[source,bash]
----
git checkout docs/readme-boilerplate
git checkout -b docs/readme-draft
----
. You can now edit the `readme.adoc` file, customizing it for your specific project.
. Once the readme is ready to be published, *copy & paste the following* into the terminal window and *hit* `Return`.
+
[source,bash]
----
git add .
git commit -m 'DOCS(readme):  author draft'
git push -u origin docs/readme-draft
git checkout main
git rm readme.adoc
git clean -f .
git commit -m 'DOCS(readme):  purge placeholder'
git merge docs/readme-draft -m 'DOCS(readme):  publish draft' --allow-unrelated-histories
git push
